# Solidity-Avax-Intermediate Assessment

This Solidity program is a simple program that shows implementation of ```require```, ```assert``` and ```revert``` statements.

## Description

This program contains simple functions that can be used to show how ```require```, ```assert``` and ```revert``` statements work in reverting and saving gas for the rest of the transaction. The functions given take an integer input and will return the integer as a result only if the given integer is less than equal to 5. Else they will revert the transaction.

## Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension. Copy and paste the code given in file.sol.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar and then click on the "Compile" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.



Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the functions. Give an unsigned integer value ( any whole number ) and call the function.
